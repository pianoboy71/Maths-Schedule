# Maths Schedule for EN Further Maths students in Year 1 (Windows only)
## What is this?
This is a small program I created with C# Winforms to keep track of all the assignments for us.
I have rolled it back so that it shows no assignments as completed, including the first one for Ella's class as our first assignment.
Read on to see how to use this program
## How do I open it?
Simply navigate to bin/Debug/net8.0-windows and open Maths Schedule.exe
## What am I looking at?
When you launch the app, you will see lists, the left side is the remaining assignments, and the right side is the completed assignments.
By default the right list will be empty, I explained why this is earlier.
There is a button on the left as well to add any assignments that I may have missed when setting this up, so if there's one I didn't put in there, add it in your program and create an issue so I can add it to the one on the repo.
I created a label at the bottom of the window to show you which assignment is next in out of the ones you have remaining. This will update when you complete an assignment
## How do I actually use it?
Scroll through the assignments on the left until you find the assignment you completed, then click it to confirm completion
If you clicked on the wrong one, then click on it in the completed list on the right, and confirm you want to un-complete it.
If the label at the bottom doesn't show entirely at the bottom of the window, you can resize the window or maximise it and you will see it fully; it doesn't default to maximised.
## What if I get stuck or have any questions?
Feel free to create an issue on here and I will try to keep on top of them all, but I might now be able to get to them all instantly.
If I don't see it in a reasonable amount of time, feel free to send me an email on my personal or college account, or ask me in person if you see me.
